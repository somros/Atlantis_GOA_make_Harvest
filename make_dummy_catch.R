# Make dummy catch file for Atlantis GOA background F based on:
# Initial biomass (1990)
# FMSY from latest stock assessment where available
# M where FMSY is not available
# Consider background F (or a starting point) 25% of FMSY or M
# This assumes that F in 2020 is comparable to F in 1990
# This code also adds catch (0) for all other fleets, to have them as placeholders
# UPDATE 2/15/2023
# Added the option to calculate catch and in turn mFC on selected age classes
# This is based on Atlantis' implementation of age selectivity, i.e. knife-edge 
# For tier 3 we put this at the age class that results in >50% selex; for all others to age at 50% maturity
