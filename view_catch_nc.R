# this script extracts and views catch in space from netcdf files
# allow for comparisons between runs (e.g., Base no MPA, MPA fully open, in the future partially closed MPAs, etc)
# allows for comparisons between a run and Adam's catch streams (aka "the truth")
# gets residuals between compared runs
# TODO: add to the function an option of getting a time series instead of the terminal average
# In fact, that should just be the default, and then any averaging could be done afterwards

# Important caveat:
# Adam allocated catches to boundary boxes and island boxes, likely as a result of a spatial join between statistical areas and Atlantis boxes
# For island boxes, catch may come from any number of the boxes around an island
# For boundary boxes, catch may be a misallocation due to the chunky box shape or it could legitimately be catch occurring off the shelf
# At the moment (6/12/2024) it seems unlikely that we will be able to fully re-run his analysis, so we need to make assumtpions for both cases
# Island boxes: split catch among neighboring boxes based on the existing proportions
# boundary boxes: assume that this is catch that occurred outside the Atlantis domain and drop it from the reconstruction

# So, is this fleet catching more arrowtooth or less pollock? 

# There is a need to calibrate this. A few ways to do it:
# 1. Manipulate mFC. This gives you control over the species and the fleet, but not over space
# 2. Manipulate MPAYYY (it takes entries >1). This gives you control over a fleet and the areas, but not the species

# When the spatial element of the setup is what causes it to underharvest, it seems sensible to use approach 2.
# Problem with that is - you amp up a fleet and you may end up overharvesting some of the species in the fleet to get the main target right

# Perhaps step 1 should be: at model-level, can we catch the same amount of a species that we get in the non-spatial setup?
# Then we can look at species and fleet makeup and compare it to the data.

# Should we change the proportions of the mFC vector? This would make us drift away from the fleet makeup of the catch of a species, which now is on point
# So perhaps you shouls start at species level: how far off is the final catch of ATF between the two setup?
# Apply that scalar to mFC - ACROSS all entries. This way, proportions of catch among fleets will be the same(ish?), but the total catch will be higher.
# Spatial distribution of catch should not change much (or should it?)
# Species makeup of each fleet WILL change (for the better or for the worse?)


# Compare total catch by species between runs -----------------------------

# Get mFC scalars and apply them to the harvest.nc file -------------------

# Also be mindful that: this may lead to grossly incorrect spatial patterns; and it may have no effect if a fishery fails in a box because its target isn't there
# Save these scalars because you will need to apply them when you change mFC (e.g. for Ftarg, FMSY, and others)
# use t=1 as first coarse pass. There will be remaining divergences
