#' Takes catch reconstruction and it modifies the catch values in boundary boxes and island boxes
#' These were non-zero in Adam's reconstruction, likely because of the the spatial join bertween the Atlantis geometry and the statistical areas 
#' We assume that:
#' Catch assigned from boundary boxes is effectively from areas off the shelf (1000m), so we discard it
#' Catch assigned to island boxes is to be redistributed to the neighbors of the island box based on catch proportions (by species, fleet, year) among the neighbors

#' Extracts catch output from Atlantis catch.nc files from one model run and compares it with data. 
#' It performs comparisons of catch composition either by species or by fleet.
#' It is set up to operate on relative catch distributions rather than raw tonnage.
#' It will produce bar charts.
