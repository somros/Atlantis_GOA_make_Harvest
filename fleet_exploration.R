# This code explores the fleet structure that Adam developed from metier analysis of GOA fish tickets
# it also identifies possible gaps in the information
# Things to look for:
# Fleet names
# Fleet target species
# Annual catches per fleet?
# Links with fish ticket / catch data (gear, target, port, etc...). Likely will need to do a new pull from AKFIN
# Spatial information - can we derive a footprint from this data?

# Adam's product contains port information so it is possible to parse out the catch of a fleet by port
# One way to do it is similar to what martin has done for CEATTLE
# We have catch from a fleet and we split it by the historical apportionment
# This assumes that fleets will keep landing to the same ports in the future, which we know is not true
# But it is as dynamic as we can get

# Comparison with catch reconstruction for catch.ts -----------------------

# From Adam:
# The spatial catch data represented by fish tickets and catch accounting data are statistical 
# areas defined by the ADFG, which differ from the spatial boxes used in the Atlantis model. 
# Catch in ADFG statistical areas are converted to Atlantis box by calculating the overlap 
# between the ADFG area and each Atlantis box. The catch is apportioned to the Atlantis boxes 
# according to the proportion of the statistical area the box overlaps with; e.g., if a given 
# Atlantis box overlaps 50% with an ADFG statistical area, then 50% of the catch in that statistical 
# area will be attributed to that Atlantis box. This may create issues for boundary boxes where little 
# fishing occurs if an ADFG statistical area with significant fishing overlaps with it, creating an erroneous spatial imputation of catch. 

# This suggests that the numbers in the RDS object from Adam should be total catch by fleet accounting for both tickets and catch accounting data
# But, to get a somewhat realistic F, we'd need to ensure that this captures global catch to satisfation
# do some vieweing and compare to:
# 1. stock assessment catch reconstructions
# 2. catch time series we did

# We will need to turn these into F's. If they are in line with the catch.ts data and/or the stock assessment catch reconstruction,
# we'll need to get best estimates of stock status (we have those) and get F based on catch (remember selex here)
# how do we parameterize selectivity for these?

# Adam recommends that the evaluation of F is done with data after 2008
# read in time series

# in the original reconstruction I mapped ADFG areas KMLAEH, but maybe Adam did not account for Cook Inlet and PWS (and the southeast)
# probably here it makes sense to stick with what Adam got, for consistency

# overall, it likely does not matter so much, because this F will require calibration anyway, until it yields catch that is in the ballpark of the catch for the desired period
