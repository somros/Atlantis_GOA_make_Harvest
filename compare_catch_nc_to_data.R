# this script extracts and views catch in space from netcdf files
# allow for comparisons between runs (e.g., Base no MPA, MPA fully open, in the future partially closed MPAs, etc)
# allows for comparisons between a run and Adam's catch streams (aka "the truth")
# gets residuals between compared runs
# TODO: add to the function an option of getting a time series instead of the terminal average
# In fact, that should just be the default, and then any averaging could be done afterwards

# Important caveat:
# Adam allocated catches to boundary boxes and island boxes, likely as a result of a spatial join between statistical areas and Atlantis boxes
# For island boxes, catch may come from any number of the boxes around an island
# For boundary boxes, catch may be a misallocation due to the chunky box shape or it could legitimately be catch occurring off the shelf
# At the moment (6/12/2024) it seems unlikely that we will be able to fully re-run his analysis, so we need to make assumptions for both cases
# Island boxes: split catch among neighboring boxes based on the existing proportions
# boundary boxes: assume that this is catch that occurred outside the Atlantis domain and drop it from the reconstruction
