# Compare flat text to nc files for catch output
# This is needed if we want to use CATCH.nc for the plotting and calibration
# The Problem:
# I want to use CATCH.nc for plots and to calculate calibration factors 
# CATCH.nc is the only file that has catch output by species, fleet, and box
# This is what Isaac thinks about this file:
# I always start with the simple CatchPerFishery.txt (which is not spatial). I trust that the most.  Then I check to see which NC files agree with it.   (I have to admit I have not played with these catch NC files in a while, and I forgot one might in units of numbers). My recollection is that whatever  NC file gave us catch per species per polygon (but not per fleet) was correct; but that no NC file correctly gave catch per species per polygon per fleet.    I can dig around more in old files, but I definitely recommend using the txt files as (spatially aggregated) truth.
# So, if we want to use, we need to:
# 1. Compare catch as FC vars (t) from the nc file to the flat txt file - not spatial
# 2. Compare catch by box between CATCH.nc and CATCHTOT.nc (we have done this before)
