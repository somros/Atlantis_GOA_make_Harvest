# This code prepares the MPAYYY vectors for the fishing fleets based on Adam's catch reconstruction
# the goal is, for each fleet:
# MPAYYY 109
# m0 m1 m2 m3 ... m108
# as a first pass, let's open fully those boxes where some fishing has occurred
# we also need to: set catches in the boudary boxes to 0, and to allocate catch from Island boxes to nearby boxes
# let's use the last 5 years of data for each fleet for the spatial coverage. Why? because we want to project this.
